## Roles in Tech

### Mission

> To inform and engage students in the diverse range of career opportunities in the technology sector and highlight the importance of soft skills.

### About

We are seeking to design, build and test an MVP which will support careers education and professional development among school leavers and undergraduate students. 

The MVP will aim to:

+ Raise awareness of the importance of ‘soft skills’ in relation to tech roles 
+ Provide a safe, accessible and engaging mechanism for students to engage with industry and learn about different tech roles 
+ Help widen participation in computer science at university 

### Case study

This project will also serve as a case study exploring the possibility of 'lean approaches in academic research'. Our goal here will be to experiment with application of agile and lean UX philosophies to a research software project. This will mean getting information from target users as early as possible in the project process within a validated learning loop, and avoiding over-reliance on assumptions derived from theoretical analyses.
